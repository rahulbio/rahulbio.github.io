[{"content":"Hi there! #I’m Rahul K, a third-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I’m passionate about web development and machine learning, always seeking new ways to apply these technologies. My focus is on mastering AI—from creating smart algorithms to exploring computer vision.\nOutside of my studies, I dive into hackathons and workshops with enthusiasm. My love for web development drives me to build intuitive applications, while machine learning fascinates me with its ability to tackle complex problems.\nIn addition to my tech pursuits, I play chess ♟️ and the piano 🎹. Whether I’m plotting my next chess move or composing a new tune, these hobbies keep my brain sharp and my creativity flowing. After all, if you can’t outsmart your opponent, at least you can entertain them with a beautiful melody!\nMy goal is to lead projects that combine AI and web technologies to make life better and more inclusive. I’m dedicated to learning and innovation, aiming to make a positive impact in the tech world—and hopefully leave a few people impressed with my coding skills (and maybe my piano playing too).\nI’m always excited to connect with others who share my interests in technology. If you’re a fellow student, industry professional, or just someone who enjoys tech, feel free to reach out. Let’s explore new possibilities together! 😄🚀\n","date":"27 April 2024","permalink":"/about/","section":"Rahul K","summary":"Hi there!","title":""},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Rahul K","summary":"","title":"Rahul K"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/computervision/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ComputerVision"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/dl/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"DL"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/fen/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"FEN"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/ml/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ML"},{"content":" #This page is still under construction.
